# Farming-App
# Owner : Poulomi Bhattacharya

This is an Android Application designed for our Indian farmers.

The technology has become a part and parcel of everyone's life and it is also helping us to make our daily tasks easy. We identified that in the Agriculture sector, the farmers are still lacking the best technology use cases.

There are thousands of applications in the markets for farmers but they only provide the limited features.

The main reason for creating this application was to combine every possible feature into the single app. This will remove the burden of managing multiple account and apps for farmers. The application is also designed in such a way that it will be easy to use.
